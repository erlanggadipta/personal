        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Main Insight:</b><br>
          Based on pizza sales data from one year in 2015, <br>
          we can see that the Classic category has the highest sales, followed by <br>
          the Supreme, Chicken, and Veggie categories in that order.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Growth Potential:</b><br>
          Since the Classic category is the most popular, <br>
          there is a significant opportunity to further increase revenue by <br>
          leveraging this popularity. One strategy that can be adopted <br>
          is to introduce new variations in the Classic category or enhance <br>
          promotions to boost sales of products in this category.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Optimizing the Supreme Category:</b> <br>
          Although the Supreme category ranks second <br>
          in sales, there is potential to further optimize sales in <br>
          this category. This can be achieved by identifying customer preferences <br>
          and adjusting marketing strategies and product offerings to increase <br>
          the appeal of the Supreme category.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Menu Diversification:</b> <br>
          Seeing that the Chicken and Veggie categories are in lower <br>
          positions in sales, there are opportunities to enhance menu variety in <br>
          these categories. There might be unmet demand from certain market segments <br>
          that can be explored to attract more customers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Bundling Offers:</b> <br>
          Given customer preferences seen from sales data, <br>
          bundling offer strategies can be applied. For instance, offering packages <br>
          that include products from both the Classic and Supreme categories at attractive prices can <br>
          drive combined sales and increase revenue.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Seasonal Analysis:</b> <br>
          Additionally, it's important to analyze sales patterns <br>
          based on seasons or specific periods. For example, there might be an increase <br>
          in sales during holiday seasons or weekends that can be leveraged by <br>
          adjusting promotional strategies.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Main Insight:</b> <br>
          The data shows that size L pizza dominates sales, <br>
          followed by size M and S pizzas. Meanwhile, <br>
          XL and XXL pizzas have lower sales levels.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Growth Potential:</b> <br>
          Since size L pizza is a customer favorite, <br>
          there is a significant opportunity to increase revenue by optimizing <br>
          sales in this category. This can be done by identifying <br>
          the factors that make size L pizza so popular and enhancing <br>
          promotions or special offers for this size.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Menu Adjustment Strategies:</b> <br>
          Seeing that size M and S pizzas also have <br>
          reasonably good sales levels, there is potential to adjust the menu or <br>
          promotions to increase the appeal of these sizes. There might be opportunities <br>
          to create special packages or special offers for sizes M and S <br>
          that can attract more customers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Optimizing Sales for Lower Sizes:</b> <br>
          Although XL and XXL pizzas have lower sales, <br>
          this does not mean they lack potential. With the right strategy, such as offering discounts or special deals, <br>
          their appeal can be increased among specific market segments.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Pricing Analysis:</b> <br>
          Further analysis related to pricing for <br>
          each pizza size is needed. There might be opportunities to adjust prices or offer <br>
          specific promotions that can drive sales for sizes with lower sales levels.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Market Segment Exploration:</b> <br>
          It is important to understand the preferences and needs <br>
          of potential customers for each pizza size. By understanding different market segments, <br>
          more effective marketing strategies can be implemented to boost sales.<br>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Main Insight:</b> <br>
          From data analysis, it is clear that the Classic Deluxe pizza variant <br>
          dominates sales as the highest, followed by <br>
          Barbeque Chicken and Hawaiian as the second and third best-selling variants.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Focus on Best-Selling Variants:</b> <br>
          Given that the Classic Deluxe variant is the most popular, <br>
          the primary focus should be on strategies to <br>
          maintain and increase sales of this variant. This can include <br>
          additional promotions, flavor variation development, or quality enhancements <br>
          to maintain customer interest.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Sales Strategies for Second and Third Variants:</b> <br>
          Although Classic Deluxe dominates sales, the Barbeque Chicken and Hawaiian variants <br>
          also have a significant market share. Sales strategies should be <br>
          designed to boost sales of these second and third variants, <br>
          including special promotions, bundling offers, or more attractive menu development.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Customer Preference Analysis:</b> <br>
          It is important to understand the reasons behind <br>
          the popularity of each pizza variant. Conducting customer surveys <br>
          or further data analysis can help uncover customer preferences <br>
          and guide strategic decisions in product development <br>
          and marketing.<br>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Identifying Low-Selling Variants:</b> <br>
          The Brie Carre, Mediterraneo, and Calabrese pizza variants <br>
          show low sales levels compared <br>
          to other variants. This indicates potential to <br>
          increase the popularity and sales of these variants.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Understanding Customer Preferences:</b> <br>
          Conducting further analysis to understand why these variants <br>
          have low sales is crucial. There may be factors such as a lack of flavor popularity or insufficient <br>
          promotion leading to low sales. By understanding customer preferences, strategies can <br>
          be designed to increase their interest in these variants.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Special Sales Strategies:</b> <br>
          Given these variants have <br>
          low sales, special sales strategies should be developed <br>
          to boost their sales. This can include discount promotions, <br>
          bundling offers with more popular products, or targeted marketing campaigns <br>
          specifically aimed at increasing customer awareness.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Product Development:</b> <br>
          Besides marketing strategies, product development might also be needed. <br>
          This can include adjusting recipes, adding new flavor variations, or adjusting <br>
          size and pricing to better match customer preferences <br>
          and market needs.<br>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Focus on High-Selling Variants:</b> <br>
          By focusing on the pizza variants with the highest sales, such as CLASSIX_DLX, <br>
          marketing and promotional strategies should be enhanced to <br>
          maintain its popularity. This can include introducing <br>
          additional promotions, developing new flavor variations, or <br>
          increasing its visibility on the menu.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Product and Pricing Adjustments:</b> <br>
          Based on the analysis, <br>
          product and pricing adjustments might be necessary. This <br>
          can include altering recipes or adding new flavor variations <br>
          for lower-selling variants, as well as <br>
          adjusting prices to better align with customer preferences and <br>
          market needs.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Developing Effective Marketing Strategies:</b> <br>
          To increase sales of low-selling variants, <br>
          appropriate marketing strategies need to be developed. <br>
          This can include special promotions, geographically or demographically <br>
          targeted advertising, or partnerships to <br>
          increase product visibility.<br>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Optimize High-Sales Days:</b> <br>
          Since Friday and Saturday have the highest sales, focus should be given <br>
          to maintaining and improving sales performance on these days. This can be done by hosting events or special promotions <br>
          that attract customers to visit on weekends.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Market Needs Analysis:</b> <br>
          It's important to understand what makes <br>
          certain days have different sales. There may be factors such as customer habits, seasonal trends, or external <br>
          influences affecting sales patterns. By understanding <br>
          these factors, strategies can be adjusted to better <br>
          meet market needs.<br>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Focus on Quarter with Highest Average Prices:</b> <br>
          Quarter 2 shows the highest average sales prices, indicating that <br>
          customers may be more willing to pay higher prices <br>
          during this period. Marketing strategies and product offerings should <br>
          be enhanced to capitalize on this potential, such as offering <br>
          premium packages or higher value-added products.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Analyze Quarter with Lowest Average Prices:</b> <br>
          While Quarter 2 has the highest average prices, Quarter 4 shows the lowest average <br>
          sales prices. This could be due to factors <br>
          such as increased competition or lower demand during <br>
          this period. Special strategies are needed to boost sales <br>
          and increase the average sales prices during this quarter.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Pricing and Offering Adjustments:</b> <br>
          Based on this analysis, it might be necessary <br>
          to adjust prices or offer special deals to <br>
          boost sales during quarters with lower average prices. <br>
          This can include special discounts, bundling offers, or <br>
          specifically targeted promotional campaigns.<br>

        <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Focus on Peak Sales Times:</b> <br>
          Since afternoon and evening <br>
          show higher sales levels, focus should be placed <br>
          on these times to increase revenue. This can include <br>
          extending operational hours, offering special promotions during these times, or adjusting stock and supply to accommodate <br>
          higher demand.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Analyze Low-Sales Times:</b> <br>
          While afternoon and evening have higher sales, morning and afternoon <br>
          show lower sales levels. It's important to <br>
          conduct further analysis to understand the factors <br>
          affecting low sales during these times, and develop <br>
          strategies to boost sales during these periods.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Menu and Offering Adjustments:</b> <br>
          Based on sales patterns over time, <br>
          it might be necessary to adjust the menu or offer special deals <br>
          to increase customer interest at certain times. <br>
          This can include adding new products that align <br>
          with consumer preferences during specific times or offering <br>
          special packages at attractive prices.<br>
